# 964 monocoque shell, from plate 50-05a

A 911-shaped body shell for the
[carbon monocoque programme](../../../docs/MONOCOQUE_964_993_PROGRAMME.md).
Until now the programme's only whole-body model was the box cell of
[`../fea/`](../fea/): good at relative questions, nothing like a 911. This
shell takes its outline from Porsche's own drawing.

*Four views of `derived/monocoque-shell.ply`. Outline from the workshop
manual; sections, thickness and openings modelled. Not a part, not a ZESAD
geometry, nothing to manufacture.*

## Where the shape comes from

Plate 50-05a of volume V ("Dimensions for assembly - from Model 91 onward")
draws the body-in-white from the side and from above, to scale, with the front
wings, doors and lids off: the outline of a monocoque. Both views were
calibrated on the markers whose fore-aft positions are published
([datum chain](../README.md#the-longitudinal-chain-closed-from-plate-50-05a)),
1.1253 and 1.1287 mm per pixel at 400 dpi, and traced
(`source/trace_plate_50_05a.py`):

| traced | used for |
|---|---|
| side view, upper profile | front lid, windscreen, roof, rear deck |
| side view, lower profile | front apron, floor, rear structure |
| plan view, half width | body width along the car |
| door aperture, quarter window, rear wheel house | openings |

The plate is not in the repository. Its trace, one point every 13.5 mm, is
`data/profiles-50-05a.json`; heights are anchored on the published 964 height
of 1310 mm.

## What is modelled, not traced

`source/build_shell.py` builds one closed section every 11 mm and stitches
them:

- a rounded lower body with a barrel side, more swollen over the rear
  quarters, up to an **880 mm beltline** (the quarter-window bottom on the
  plate);
- above it a superellipse greenhouse to the roof, which gives the 911
  tumblehome; where the profile drops under the belt, a crowned lid;
- openings cut along continuous fields, so their edges stay smooth: doors and
  quarter windows from the plate, windscreen and rear window between the
  pillars, front-lid and engine-lid openings, open engine bay underside, both
  wheel arches;
- a front bulkhead under the scuttle, a rear bulkhead behind the seats, four
  cylindrical wheel houses.

Section shapes, beltline, glass and lid extents, wheel-house radii and
bulkhead heights are **modelling hypotheses**. No sheet thickness,
reinforcement or sill box section is drawn.

## A first whole-body calculation

`source/torsion.py` runs the box model's torsion load case on the structural
shell (shell and bulkheads, without the wheel houses, which are not connected
node to node): rear suspension area clamped, ±1000 N at the front wheel-house
tops, linear S3 shells, uniform 0.8 mm steel.

**K = 2,261 N·m/deg.** It is the stiffness of this surface model under this
load, not of a 964 body shell: the door and window apertures are open, there
is no glass, no boxed sill, no wheel house in the load path, and the mesh is
not converged. What holds is where the load goes: around the windscreen
frame, into the A-pillars and the corners of the door apertures, and across
the C-pillars, with the floor and the roof lightly loaded. The hot spots
around the front wheel-house tops are local: that is where the load is applied. That is the open
shell a monocoque has to close.

## Reproduce

In the `cadsim` image, with shapely from the print-simulation library folder:

    python3 source/trace_plate_50_05a.py page9-009.png   # only with the local plate
    python3 source/build_shell.py      # derived/monocoque-shell.ply and -structural.npz
    python3 source/torsion.py          # derived/torsion-snapshot.npz
    python3 source/figures.py          # evidence/*.png
    python3 ../fea/hero.py             # the home-page banner

## Limits

- The outline is Porsche's to the plate's drawing accuracy (about ±4 mm on
  the calibration markers); everything between outlines is modelled.
- The plate shows a 964 from model year 1991; the 993 shares the floor and
  the datum points, not the outer panels.
- No thickness, material or layup is proposed here. The shell carries the
  programme's `prohibited_pending_engineering` status: it is a design
  envelope, not a part.
